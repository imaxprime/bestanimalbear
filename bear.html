	<h1>Bears are the best!</h1>
		
		<p>Bears are the best animals in the world hands down. They can both be fierce and strong, whilst also being caring and soft. Incase you haven't figured it out yet, I'm not refering the the real animal called a Bear but as a man I know named Bear! HA
		</p>

		<p>Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. Stay focused. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there.
